    PHP 5 and the integrated Zend Engine 2 have greatly improved PHP's
    performance and capabilities, but great care has been taken to break as
    little existing code as possible. So migrating your code from PHP 4 to 5
    should be very easy. Most existing PHP 4 code should be ready to run
    without changes, but you should still know about the <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration5.incompatible.php" class="link">few differences</a> and
    take care to test your code before switching versions in production
    environments.
